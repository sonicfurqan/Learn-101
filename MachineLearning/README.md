# Machine Learning 101

"Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." -- Arthur Samuels (1959)

## Python

What is machine learning?

    In simple terms you feed a computer some input and it gives you some output based on some pre-trained recipe.

    Pre-trained recipe: it is algorithms that perform operation on dataset that is provided computes is trains itself on what that data is   and when unknown data is given to it predicts its outcome based on training

3 Types of machine learning

    Supervised learning

    Unsupervised learning

    Reinforced learning

1.Supervised learning

    Here you train a system with data set and its associated labels.

    You are telling a system that this is equals to this and learn from that. Then when new data is given to system it will find the probability of being equal to what it is trained on

    Example:

    Cats and dogs

    You train a system with dogs and cats picture with respective label

    And when you ask a system to predict a new image that was not available in training  set it will return its probability being either cat or dog

2.Unsupervised learning

    Here you train a system with cluster of data that does not have any label.

    Then you ask a system to predict next outcome for given data

    Example 1:

    You feed a system with the data of all the houses with their respective rooms, area, price

    And then you ask a system what may be the price of house if it has this numbers of rooms, area

    Example 2:

    You feed a system with the data of weather from previous year

    And then you ask a system what may be the weather next year

    Basically, it calculates continues plot in data

3.Reinforced learning

    Here you put a system in one environment and provides the conditions of environment and its boundaries, rewards, dangers.

    Then run the system in environment and let system train from its mistakes

    Example:

    You put a system in Mario game.

    You define boundaries I.e. Mario can run only this speed, it can jump only this much etc

    conditions I.e. press right arrow =runs, b + right arrow=fast run, a=jump, a + right arrow=forward jump ..etc.

    Rewards I.e. reaching the castle

    Dangers I.e. it cannot touch birds, monkeys, should not fall in pit.etc.

Basics:
basic functions of following library
numpy
pandas
is included in basics folder

Lesson 1:

    Let's start with most basic

    Linear regression

    with ordinary least square

    And using gradient decent
